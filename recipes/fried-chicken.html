    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fried chicken is one of the most popular dishes in the world. Many countires have their own twist and take on fried chicken, from the sweet and savory chicken of Korea, to the red, hot and spicy fried chicken of Nashivlle, Tennese.</p>
    <p>I, personally, enjoy KFC more than any other brand. Sure, fried chicken made at home can taste truly delicious, but it just seems to miss that omph. I don't know what that omph might be, exactly, but it's there, it's noticable, and I just can't put my finger on it.</p>
